<h1> About Me</h1>
<img src="/Images/btcs.webp" alt="BT LOGO">
<h2> My Backround</h2>
<p>I'm a freshman at Bergen County Technical Schools in Teterboro, enrolled in the Computer Science
program. I chose this program because I've always been interested in technology, i love to play video games, and my dad majored in computer science. <br> <br>
Outside of school, I enjoy playing video games, talking with friends,<br>scrolling through social media and sleeping. Both my mom and dad are dominican and my grandparents 
were born in the <b>Domincan Republic </b> and moved to the <b>United States.</b>  <br>
